This are the full implementation of OCR program to detect numbers on Indonesia's Vehicle License Plate using Transformer model approach by utilizing TrOCR structure. The model used pretrained weights from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10282) and then finetuned using total of 4000 augmented data on Indonesia's Vehicle License Plate images.
